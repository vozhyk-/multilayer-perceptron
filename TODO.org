* parse the rest of the datasets
** horse colic:
*** divide into input / expected output
** ionosphere:
*** parse
*** divide into input / expected output
* make neural network outputs categorical (round to integers)
* use a different error metric (count(correct outputs) / number of outputs)
* make a function to calculate the error on the test set
* make a GUI with:
** a graph of x=generation, y=error on the training set
** a display of the error on the test set
** a choice of 1 or 2 hidden layers
** a way to enter each hidden layer's number of neurons
